<article>
<p> The story of our trip to New York City continues with attending a Yankees game. Having very fond memories of doing this, as both a child and adult, it is something I want my wife to experience with me.</p>
<p>There is more to enjoying the game than just the game itself. Enjoying the junk food of the stadium, doing the wave and cheering or jeering with the rest of the die hard fans.</p>
