<p>My story continues this week, with my wife and I arriving in New York, and setting out to see the sights. There are some challenges along the way that require things like eating and obtaining a new pair of shoes.</p>
<p>All kidding aside, this is something that is actually close to my heart, and I can't wait to take my wife back to New York!</p>
