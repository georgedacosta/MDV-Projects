<h2>Learnability</h2>
<p>The acceptance of foreigners or outsiders will vary from region to region. In some regions of Brazil the locals have gone out of their way to learn about their Spanish tourists culture. Spanish speaking tourists are greeted with Spanish signs, food they can appreciate, and a welcoming attitude. In other regions if you so much as look like a tourist, you may be charged much higher prices in gas stations and restaurants, you will also find yourself being treated in a rather cool manner by the locals</p>
